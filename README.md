Built this project overnight for the Smart India Hackathon 2020 college round. As the ML model had to be built in a few hours of time we could'nt obtain the best dataset. This is why the accuracy is around 67%. With a better dataset this model would have been able to predict with a much higher accuracy. We used Multiple Linear Regression to buid our ML model.

Key points:
- Built a ML model capable of predicting crop yield based on factors like geographical location, type of crop, season and area under cultivation
- After yield is predicted, compensation is determined in case of loss on the basis of a threshold value
- Aims to eliminate the uncertainties in agriculture
